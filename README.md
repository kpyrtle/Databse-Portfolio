# Elevate Retail - Project Overview
Elevate Retail was a collaborative capstone project focused on building a complete infrastructure for a startup e-commerce business. The goal was to design a scalable, secure, and reliable system to support customer accounts, product listings, orders, shipping, and inventory while coordinating with other teams like networking, web development, cybersecurity, and data analytics.


### My Role â€” Database Administrator (Student)
As part of the DBA team, I was responsible for designing and implementing the core database system in SQL Server. My responsibilities included:
- Analyzing business requirements from the case study
- Designing an Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram (EERD)
- Creating and managing SQL Server database schema
- Enforcing data integrity via keys and constraints
- Setting up basic user roles and access controls
- Planning backup and recovery strategies
- Ensuring cross-team access to shared data (via network drives in NetLab)


### Key Accomplishments
- Finalized a complete EERD and built all related tables
- Populated the database with sample data for testing
- Implemented role-based access control
- Developed a working backup and restore plan
- Supported integration across NetLab pods for team-wide access


### Challenges and Resolutions
| Challenge                                                      | Resolution                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Database and backup files were lost during a system migration  | Collaborated with instructors and NetLab admin to recover and rebuild the database   |
| Copy-paste restrictions in virtual environment slowed progress | Manually typed lost scripts and managed backups more diligently                  |
| Keeping alignment with cross-functional teams                  | Maintained communication with all teams to ensure data consistency and project goals |


### Project Goals Met
- Built a clean, normalized database structure
- Enabled secure, controlled data access for all teams
- Maintained stability through backup/recovery planning
- Successfully supported a multi-team collaborative environment
